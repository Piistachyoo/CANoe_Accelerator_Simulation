The project is about simulating 2 ECUs, providing communication between an accelerator pedal and a speedometer!

- ECU1: Is responsible for periodically checking if the accelerometer is pressed - from checking a system variable - and sending the status of the accelerometer to ECU2

- ECU2: Is responsible for changing the speed according to the status of the accelerometer pedal

  

This project allowed me to:

✔️ Write a database using CANdb to add my ECUs, messages, and signals.

✔️ Write a CAPL script for each ECU to provide a simulation with correct actions.

✔️ Create a GUI to visualize and interact with the data on the bus

✔️ Get hands-on experience with Vector's popular tool, CANoe!

✔️ Know more about CAN bus messages, signals, and simulation.
